# SPREAD: Sampling-based Pareto front Refinement via Efficient Adaptive Diffusion

> SPREAD is a novel sampling-based approach for multi-objective optimization that leverages diffusion models to efficiently refine and generate well-spread Pareto front approximations. It combines the expressiveness of diffusion models with multi-objective optimization principles to achieve both high convergence to the Pareto front and excellent diversity across the objective space. SPREAD demonstrates competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods while providing a flexible framework for different optimization contexts.
